# Publish Nest js module on npm.github

Welcome to the repository for our first Node module published as an npm package! This project is aimed at providing a template 
to publish a nest js module to npm.github

## Installation

To install the package, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. Set up your `.npmrc` file in your project directory or create one if it doesn't exist.

   Add the following content to the `.npmrc` file:
```
@raezon:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=xxx
```
2. Install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install @raezon/first_nest_package
```
3 Usage
Once the package is installed, you can import and use it in your Node.js project. Here's an example:
Import it on your module first 
```
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { TestModule } from '@raezon/first_nest_package';

@Module({
  imports: [TestModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
than use the service
```
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TestService } from '@raezon/first_nest_package';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: TestService) {}

  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.findAll();
  }
}

```
Please refer to the package's documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples.
